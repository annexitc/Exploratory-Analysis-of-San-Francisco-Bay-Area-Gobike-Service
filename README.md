# (Exploratory Analysis of San Francisco Bay Area Gobike Service)
## by (Anuoluwa Ayodele)


## Dataset

> The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are 171,494 bike rides in the dataset. The main features of interest in this dataset is duration_minutes, user_type, distance, user_age and member_gender column. 


## Summary of Findings

> In my exploration, I discovered that 90% of users do not share their rides, leaving 10% of users that do. 91% of users are subscribers, compared to 9% of consumers who just occasionally use the bike system. Riders are 32 years old on average. Users primarily used the bike sharing service for short trips of up to 4 kilometers. Males make up the majority of bikeshare users. 75% of users are men, 23% are women, and 2% are other users. The majority of the rides took place during the week (Monday through Friday)suggesting that it was primarily used for commuting to work. 
> The majority of trips using the bike sharing program are under 15 minutes in duration. Those who are "Customers" typically travelled further than users who are "Subscribers." The average trip length and age of individuals who did not share the bike for their journeys were longer than those who used it exclusively. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The exploratory analysis shows that 91% of the users were subscribers while 9% were casual users (customers). Customer user type are generally older users when compared with Subscribers. Customer users usually use the bike rides to travel far distances which makes them to spend longer duration in minutes to cover their rides. It is also interesting that despite the age and distance covered by customers, they do not share their rides with other people in all their bike trips. Customers' typical bike trips last longer on weekends.

>On the contrary, subscribers are middle aged users (between 20 - 40years) who travelled short distances within averagely short durations in minutes and majorily sharing their bikes. Overall, Subscribers have higher number of trips than customers across all days of the week. Moreover, Thursday has the most ‘Subscriber’ and ‘Customer’ bikers compared to other days. Majority of the subscriber who share their rides are male. In general, female riders do longer bike trips than male riders and therefore do not share their rides.
